Neural Network from Scratch
Project Overview

This repository contains a hands-on implementation of a basic neural network built entirely from scratch using Python and fundamental mathematical operations. The goal of this project is to provide a clear, step-by-step understanding of how neural networks work under the hood, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

If you're looking to demystify neural networks and understand the core concepts of forward propagation, backward propagation (backpropagation), and gradient descent, you've come to the right place!
Features Pure Python Implementation: No external deep learning libraries are used, ensuring a fundamental understanding of each component.

    Modular Design: The code is structured to make it easy to follow the flow from input to output and back.

    Core Concepts Covered:

        Initialization of weights and biases.

        Activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid, ReLU).

        Forward propagation.

        Loss calculation (e.g., Mean Squared Error).

        Backward propagation (Backpropagation) for gradient computation.

        Gradient Descent for weight and bias updates.

    Simple Example: Includes a basic example to demonstrate the network's learning capabilities on a small dataset.
